# GCP Professional Cloud Architect Exam Question Extractor

## Project Overview
This application extracts, parses, and analyzes Google Professional Cloud Architect certification exam questions from PDF documents. It processes community answers, identifies correct solutions, and provides structured output with LLM-powered analysis.
All the extracted questions, answers should be easily searchable, filterable from a simple HTML.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Data Extraction & Parsing
- Process PDF files from `./data/input`
- Handle split PDF files: Questions_1.pdf, Questions_2.pdf, Questions_3.pdf, etc.
- Extract questions, answer options, community responses, and metadata
- Track page numbers for all operations and analyses

### 2. Question Structure Analysis
Parse each question containing:
- **Introductory Context**: Case studies, company backgrounds, and scenario descriptions (e.g., "Dress4Win is a web-based company that helps their users organize and select outfits...")
- Question number and description with complete context
- Multiple choice options (A, B, C, D, E, F)
- Community answers with voting information
- Timestamps and user classifications (Highly Voted, Most Recent, etc.)
- Topic classification

**CRITICAL**: Questions must include full introductory context when present. Many GCP exam questions reference case studies like:
- "For this question, refer to the Dress4Win case study"
- "TerramEarth is a heavy equipment manufacturer..."
- "Mountkirk Games makes online, session-based, multiplayer games..."

The extraction must capture the complete case study description that precedes the actual question to provide full context for analysis.

### 3. Content Filtering
**IGNORE these elements:**
- Page numbers
- URLs: "https://www.examtopics.com/exams/google/professional-cloud-architect/custom-view/"
- Community usernames, logos, and images
- Navigation elements

### 4. LLM-Powered Analysis
- **MUST** use Claude API for real-time question analysis
- **NO hardcoded answers**
- Send each question + options to LLM for correct answer determination
- Include reasoning for each answer choice
- Leverage GCP Data Architect expertise perspective

### 5. Text Enhancement
Process all extracted text through NLP/LLM pipeline to:
- Fix OCR errors and text recognition issues
- Correct grammar and spelling
- Handle text that spans across pages
- Ensure readability and coherence

### 6. Unique Question Identification
- Handle duplicate questions across pages
- Create unique identifiers using "Question No + Page No" format
- Implement auto-increment for unique question numbering
- Track question variations and duplicates

### 7. Advanced Interactive Web UI
- **Modern responsive interface** with GCP-themed corporate colors
- **Smart search and filtering** across all content (questions, answers, comments, metadata)
- **Answer marking system** with persistent localStorage storage across sessions
- **Answer highlighting** with visual indicators (green=correct, blue=user selected, red=wrong)
- **Auto-increment numbering** as primary key system for consistent question identification
- **Exam evaluation system** with GCP 70% passing threshold and detailed scoring
- **Interactive upload interface** with drag-and-drop PDF processing
- **Quality warnings system** with detailed extraction issues and clickable navigation
- **Question editing capabilities** with correct answer marking and JSON persistence
- **Indicator-based filtering** - click evaluation metrics to filter question types
- **Pagination system** (25 questions per page) optimized for performance
- **Real-time processing logs** with dynamic statistics and status updates 

## Output Format

Generate tabular output with these columns:
```
Question No | Question Description | Answer Options | Community Answer | Highly Voted Answer | Most Recent Answer | Claude Answer | Latest Date | Topic | Page Number | Source
```

### Example Output Row:
```
1 | Your company has decided to make a major revision of their API in order to create better experiences for their developers... | A. Configure a new load balancer B. Reconfigure old clients C. Have the old API forward traffic D. Use separate backend pools | D | D | C | D | 3 days ago | Topic 1 | 12 | Question_1.pdf
```

## Technical Implementation Requirements

### 1. Modular Architecture
- Separate modules for PDF processing, text extraction, LLM integration
- Error handling and logging for each component
- Progress tracking and resumable processing

### 2. PDF Processing Strategy
- **DO NOT** attempt to process entire document at once
- Implement chunk-based processing for better accuracy
- Allow selective processing of specific pages/sections
- Enable reprocessing and revision of specific parts

### 3. LLM Integration
- Real-time Claude API integration
- Structured prompting for consistent analysis
- Include GCP expertise context in prompts
- Handle API rate limits and error responses

### 4. Data Quality Assurance
- Validate extracted question formats
- Cross-reference community answers
- Identify and flag inconsistencies
- Track confidence levels for extracted data

### 5. Error Handling & Recovery
- Graceful handling of malformed PDF sections
- Recovery mechanisms for API failures
- Detailed logging with page number references
- Ability to restart from specific points

## Development Approach

### Phase 1: PDF Processing Foundation
1. Implement PDF text extraction
2. Create question boundary detection
3. Develop page tracking system
4. Test with sample PDF chunks

### Phase 2: Content Parsing
1. Parse question structures
2. Extract answer options and community data
3. Implement text cleaning and enhancement
4. Create unique ID generation system

### Phase 3: LLM Integration
1. Design Claude API integration
2. Create structured prompts for GCP questions
3. Implement answer analysis pipeline
4. Add reasoning and explanation capture

### Phase 4: Output Generation
1. Create tabular output formatter
2. Implement data validation
3. Add export capabilities
4. Create summary and statistics

### Phase 5: HTML Web UI
1. Create a simple HTML Web UI
2. Search, Filter options must be available for any item (question, answer, date, topic, source file etc.)
3. Web UI should read the extracted final outputs dynamicaly (or maybe it can static)

## Quality Control Measures

### 1. Validation Checkpoints
- Verify question completeness
- Validate answer option extraction
- Cross-check page number references
- Confirm LLM response quality
- use the Playwright MCP to compare the input PDF file and output results in CSV and HTML Web UI also

### 2. Testing Strategy
- Test with known good questions
- Validate against different PDF sections
- Check edge cases and malformed content
- Verify LLM analysis accuracy

### 3. Manual Review Points
- Flag questions with low confidence
- Identify potential duplicate questions
- Review LLM reasoning for accuracy
- Validate community answer interpretation
