The company also cultivates an active social network that connects their users with designers and retailers. They monetize their services through advertising, e-commerce, referrals, and a premium app model. Company Background - Dress4Win's application has grown from a few servers in the founder's garage to several hundred servers and appliances in a collocated data center. However, the capacity of their infrastructure is now insuOcient for the application's rapid growth. Because of this growth and the company's desire to innovate faster, Dress4Win is committing to a full migration to a public cloud. Solution Concept - For the Krst phase of their migration to the cloud, Dress4Win is considering moving their development and test environments. They are also considering building a disaster recovery site, because their current infrastructure is at a single location. They are not sure which components of their architecture they can migrate as is and which components they need to change before migrating them. Existing Technical Environment - The Dress4Win application is served out of a single data center location. Databases: - MySQL - user data, inventory, static data - Redis - metadata, social graph, caching Application servers: - Tomcat - Java micro-services - Nginx - static content - Apache Beam - Batch processing Storage appliances: - iSCSI for VM hosts - Fiber channel SAN - MySQL databases - NAS - image storage, logs, backups Apache Hadoop/Spark servers: - Data analysis - Real-time trending calculations MQ servers: - Messaging - Social notiKcations - Events Miscellaneous servers: - Jenkins, monitoring, bastion hosts, security scanners Business Requirements - Build a reliable and reproducible environment with scaled parity of production.",
