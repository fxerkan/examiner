The company also cultivates an active social network that connects their users with designers and retailers. They monetize their services through advertising, e-commerce, referrals, and a freemium app model. The application has grown from a few servers in the founder's garage to several hundred servers and appliances in a colocated data center. However, the capacity of their infrastructure is now insuOcient for the application's rapid growth. Because of this growth and the company's desire to innovate faster, Dress4Win is committing to a full migration to a public cloud. Solution Concept - For the Krst phase of their migration to the cloud, Dress4Win is moving their development and test environments. They are also building a disaster recovery site, because their current infrastructure is at a single location.

For those saying C, the question is about ""automating the deployment"" in line with the business requirements. Going from MySQL to datastore might be a good idea long term, but it won't make automating the deployment to the cloud any easier or smoother. Automate the deployment to Cloud SQL because it's a natural fit, and once that's working, re-assess the requirements to decide if it's worth the hefty lift of shifting from MySQL to a NoSQL Document DB. upvoted 1 times Eroc Highly Voted 4 years, 1 month ago The requriements also specify: ""Easily create non-production environment in the cloud.

However, the capacity of their infrastructure is now insuOcient for the application's rapid growth. Because of this growth and the company's desire to innovate faster, Dress4Win is committing to a full migration to a public cloud. Solution Concept - For the Krst phase of their migration to the cloud, Dress4Win is moving their development and test environments. They are also building a disaster recovery site, because their current infrastructure is at a single location. They are not sure which components of their architecture they can migrate as is and which components they need to change before migrating them.

Improve security by deKning and adhering to a set of security and Identity and Access Management (IAM) best practices for cloud. Improve business agility and speed of innovation through rapid provisioning of new resources. Analyze and optimize architecture for performance in the cloud. Technical Requirements - Easily create non-production environments in the cloud. Implement an automation framework for provisioning resources in cloud. Implement a continuous deployment process for deploying applications to the on-premises datacenter or cloud. Support failover of the production environment to cloud during an emergency. Encrypt data on the wire and at rest. Support multiple private connections between the production data center and cloud environment. Executive Statement - Our investors are concerned about our ability to scale and contain costs with our current infrastructure. They are also concerned that a competitor could use a public cloud platform to offset their up-front investment and free them to focus on developing better features. Our traOc patterns are highest in the mornings and weekend evenings; during other times, 80% of our capacity is sitting idle. Our capital expenditure is now exceeding our quarterly projections. Migrating to the cloud will likely cause an initial increase in spending, but we expect to fully transition before our next hardware refresh cycle. Our total cost of ownership (TCO) analysis over the next 5 years for a public cloud strategy achieves a cost reduction between 30% and 50% over our current model. Question For this question, refer to the Dress4Win case study. You are responsible for the security of data stored in Cloud Storage for your company, Dress4Win. You have already created a set of Google Groups and assigned the appropriate users to those groups. You should use Google best practices and implement the simplest design to meet the requirements. Considering Dress4Win's business and technical requirements, what should you do? A. Assign custom IAM roles to the Google Groups you created in order to enforce security requirements. Encrypt data with a customer- supplied encryption key when storing Kles in Cloud Storage. B. Assign custom IAM roles to the Google Groups you created in order to enforce security requirements. Enable default storage encryption before storing Kles in Cloud Storage. C. Assign predeKned IAM roles to the Google Groups you created in order to enforce security requirements. Utilize Google's default encryption at rest when storing Kles in Cloud Storage. D. Assign predeKned IAM roles to the Google Groups you created in order to enforce security requirements. Ensure that the default Cloud KMS key is set before storing Kles in Cloud Storage.
