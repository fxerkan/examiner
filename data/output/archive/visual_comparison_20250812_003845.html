                <div class="content" style="max-height: 200px;">Your company has decided to make a major revision of their API in order to create better experiences for their developers. They need to keep the old version of the API available and deployable, while allowing new customers and testers to try out the new API. They want to keep the same SSL and DNS records in place to serve both APIs. What should they do? ÔÖá ÔÄá shandy Highly Voted ÔÖ§ 2 months, 4 weeks ago D is the answer because HTTP(S) load balancer can direct traffic reaching a single IP to different backends based on the incoming URL. A is not correct because configuring a new load balancer would require a new or different SSL and DNS records which conflicts with the requirements to keep the same SSL and DNS records. B is not correct because it goes against the requirements. The company wants to keep the old API available while new customers and testers try the new API. C is not correct because it is not a requirement to decommission the implementation behind the old API. Moreover, it introduces unnecessary risk in case bugs or incompatibilities are discovered in the new API. upvoted 104 times ÔÖá ÔÄá AzureDP900 2 years, 2 months ago D is right upvoted 3 times ÔÖá ÔÄá AWS56 Highly Voted ÔÖ§ 5 years ago agreed, The answer is D upvoted 19 times ÔÖá ÔÄá FI22 Most Recent ÔÄó 1 week, 3 days ago D is good for keep the same records. upvoted 1 times</div>

        D because This approach allows you to keep the same SSL and DNS records while directing traffic based on the API path. The load balancer can
        be configured to route requests to different backend pools depending on whether the request is for the old or new API version. This ensures that
        both versions are accessible under the same domain, providing a seamless transition for both old and new users.

During peak load, users report that they can see news articles they already viewed. What is the most likely cause of this problem? ÔÖá ÔÄá jackdbd Highly Voted ÔÖ§ 2 months, 4 weeks ago It's A. AppEngine spins up new containers automatically according to the load. During peak traffic, HTTP requests originated by the same user could be served by different containers. Given that the variable `sessions` is recreated for each container, it might store different data. The problem here is that this Flask app is stateful. The `sessions` variable is the state of this app. And stateful variables in AppEngine / Cloud Run / Cloud Functions are problematic. A solution would be to store the session in some database (e.g. Firestore, Memorystore) and retrieve it from there. This way the app would fetch the session from a single place and would be stateless. upvoted 115 times</div>

ÔÖá ÔÄá sdsdfasdf4 Highly Voted ÔÖ§ 3 years, 12 months ago The easiest way would be to create template from --source-instance, and then create MIG, but it is not listed here, also you cannot create a MIG from image directly, you need a template, so answer is C (image -> template -> mig). upvoted 30 times ÔÖá ÔÄá 6721sora 2 years, 3 months ago C is correct. To sdsdfasd4's point - Not recommended to create template from --source-instance as If the existing instance contains a static external IP address, that address is copied into the instance template and might limit the use of the template. Templates are best created from images or other templates. Creating the template from a running instance may require work to clean it up before it can be used for a MIG upvoted 8 times ÔÖá ÔÄá AWS56 Highly Voted ÔÖ§ 4 years, 11 months ago C is the right answer upvoted 12 times ÔÖá ÔÄá heretolearnazure 1 year, 3 months ago C is definitely the right answer upvoted 1 times ÔÖá ÔÄá nareshthumma Most Recent ÔÄó 1 month, 3 weeks ago Answer A: Create a snapshot of the existing disk. Create an instance template from the snapshot. Create an autoscaled managed instance group from the instance template. Here‚Äôs why this option is the best: 1.Autoscaling: By creating an autoscaled managed instance group, you can automatically adjust the number of instances based on the load. This means that during peak business hours, additional instances will be created to handle the increased traffic, improving application performance. During off-peak hours, the number of instances can scale down to reduce costs. 2.Snapshot Creation: Taking a snapshot of the existing disk ensures that you have a backup of the current state of your application. This snapshot can be used to create the new instance template, ensuring that your autoscaled instances have the same configuration as the original instance. upvoted 1 times ÔÖá ÔÄá 46f094c 5 months, 3 weeks ago I prefer B, is better because I don't need to stop the instance to create the disk image. upvoted 1 times</div>

You want to restrict communications between instances to only the paths and ports you authorize, but you don't want to rely on static IP addresses or subnets because the app can autoscale. How should you restrict communications? ÔÖá ÔÄá AWS56 Highly Voted ÔÖ§ 3 years, 5 months ago Agree B upvoted 24 times ÔÖá ÔÄá kumarp6 2 years, 7 months ago Yes B it is upvoted 2 times ÔÖá ÔÄá nitinz 2 years, 3 months ago B is correct upvoted 2 times ÔÖá ÔÄá omermahgoub Highly Voted ÔÖ§ 6 months ago To restrict communications between VM instances within a VPC without relying on static IP addresses or subnets, you can use firewall rules based on network tags attached to the compute instances. This will allow you to specify which instances are allowed to communicate with each other and on which paths and ports. You can then attach the relevant network tags to the compute instances when they are created, allowing you to control communication between the instances without relying on static IP addresses or subnets. upvoted 11 times ÔÖá ÔÄá omermahgoub 6 months ago Option A, using separate VPCs to restrict traffic, would not be a suitable solution because it would not allow the instances to communicate with each other, which is likely necessary for the functioning of the web application. Option C, using Cloud DNS and only allowing connections from authorized hostnames, would not be a suitable solution because it would not allow you to control communication between the instances based on their IP addresses or other characteristics. Option D, using service accounts and configuring the web application to authorize particular service accounts to have access, would not be a suitable solution because it would not allow you to control communication between the instances based on their IP addresses or other characteristics. upvoted 4 times</div>

        The keyword in this context is OLAP. CloudSQL is Relational SQL for OLTP. Capacity wise, BQ supports for PB+ while CloudSQL only have max
        capacity of up to ~10TB. Again the questions specifically mention "hundreds of TB of data". So D is the answer.

What should you do? gcloud command. from the GCP Console. ÔÖá ÔÄá Unfaithful Highly Voted ÔÖ§ 2 years, 5 months ago Answer: A Support: How does Horizontal Pod Autoscaler work with Cluster Autoscaler? Horizontal Pod Autoscaler changes the deployment's or replicaset's number of replicas based on the current CPU load. If the load increases, HPA will create new replicas, for which there may or may not be enough space in the cluster. If there are not enough resources, CA will try to bring up some nodes, so that the HPA-created pods have a place to run. If the load decreases, HPA will stop some of the replicas. As a result, some nodes may become underutilized or completely empty, and then CA will terminate such unneeded nodes. upvoted 62 times ÔÖá ÔÄá heretolearnazure 3 months, 3 weeks ago very well explained upvoted 1 times ÔÖá ÔÄá AzureDP900 1 year, 2 months ago Nice and detailed explanation.

         does that make D the right answer? And with D, you need the logs viewer role. The question is a bad one as it doesn't clarify any roles in this
